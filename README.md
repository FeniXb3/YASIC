Yet Another Space Invaders Clone

#### Space Invaders
Space Invaders is an arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. It is one of the earliest *shooting games* and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible.

#### Gameplay
*Space Invaders* is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon.
